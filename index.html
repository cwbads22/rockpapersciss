        <h1>Rock, Paper & Scissors Game - V 1.0</h1>
        <p>Rock, Paper & Scissors Game for the Odin Project.<br>
           My ideia was to develop the game with the shortest code<br>
           possible. It doesn't have a counter yet nor any HTML<br>
           manipulation. My objective was only the Logics now.<br>
           It'll be developed with more functions as long as I<br>
           learn them.</p>
